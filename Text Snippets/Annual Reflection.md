### Past Year Reflections & Insights
- Biggest wins for the year? ;  In what moments did it feel like I was working within my zone of genius?

- Biggest challenge(s) I overcame?
- How did I rise to that/those challenges? How did I change in the process?
- What made me most happy this year?
- What made me most satisfied or proud?
- What bummed me out the most? Could I have done more to avoid it? Does it still bother me? Should I just let it go and move on?
- Who had the biggest positive impact on my life?
- What patterns and feedback loops had an impact on my life in the past year? Did they help or hurt?
- What do I get excited about discussing or thinking about? & What aspect of that excites me?
- What does that say about my values?
- How do my values influence my level of happiness? (good or bad)
- What is more important to me, happiness or peace? Is there a difference? Do I favor one over the other? If so, why?
- What are my biggest discoveries and learnings from the past year? ;  Our jobs (and by extension our days, weeks, and even years) get stale when we’re stagnant. Reflect on new skills you picked up in the past year or opportunities you had to stretch beyond your previous capabilities. If things stayed the same, consider whether that works for you or if it’s time to try out something new.
- Consider your daily progress : Think about how much you’re getting done each day. Review any daily to-do lists you have on hand, whether they’re from earlier this quarter or just the other day. Pay attention to what you wrote down versus what you actually got done. Consider whether you’re structuring your day in a way that helps you focus on your priorities and move towards your goals. If not, take our quiz to find a productivity method that works for you –– whether that’s time blocking, pomodoro, GTD, or something else entirely.
	- How satisfied am I with what I accomplished this   year?
	- What factors might have contributed to accomplishing less than I wanted this year?
	- When am I the most productive? How can I create these conditions more often?
	- When am I least productive? How can I avoid these conditions more often?
- Reflect on your mental health & Physical Health : Think about how you coped with the stresses of life over the past year. Note whether you felt any sadness, anxiety, or anger and how you dealt with those emotions in both healthy and counterproductive ways. Write down strategies to start or continue prioritizing your overall wellbeing in the coming year (e.g. journaling, meditation, therapy, exercise, etc...).

### Next Year Design
- Describe what my life will be like in 3 months, how will it be different if things go according to plan. Visualize this, feel it. At the end of next year, if you are drastically exceeding your expectations, what would you be doing?

- What new and unfamiliar activities and experiences will I undertake this year?
-  What am I going to absolutely make happen this year? (that is under my control)
- What is standing between me and those outcomes?
- How can I change the equation or influence those obstacles in my favor?
- What scares me about this undertaking? Why am I fearful of that? (or what makes me nervous if 'fear' is too strong)
- What specific actions can I take to remove obstacles and advance toward the goal this month? Then the month after that?
- What behaviors are repeatedly causing negative outcomes or negative feedback loops?
- How am I going to improve your personal/family economic situation this year?
- How am I going to advance your learning and discovery the next year?
- How do I need to change to become the person who can achieve that?
- What new habits & routines can I employ to become that person?
- Who or what can I bring into my life to help me become that person?
